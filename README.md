## Here is my DataWrapper image of my flight etiquette data:

## Here is a copy of the CSV of the flight ettiquetee data I worked on: 
[Keynes Le-Flying etiquette - Pivot Table 1.csv](https://github.com/keyle2112/quiz4-question6/blob/main/Keynes%20Le-Flying%20etiquette%20-%20Pivot%20Table%201.csv)

## Why I picked the question above? 
As someone who loves to travel and goes on a lot of flights, I've had that dilemma of whether it is rude to ask the sleeping person next to me to use the restroom. In my mind, I believe it's rude to wake people up and to use the restroom during a flight is no different. However, from the data, I found that a majority of people felt it wasn't rude, which was very surprising to me. The most surprising statistic to me was that only 34 people found it very rude to wake up the people next to them to ask to use the restroom.
